1. "/suicide_prevention_forum_scraper_ruby" has a scraper to get text from suicide prevention/help forums for analysis of content for the program that I was involved with for research.

2. There's also an implementation of tweet collector in "/tweet_aggregator_based_on_emotion_keyword_python", which samples a certain number of tweets periodically that mention/include words listed in "filter_words" using Twitter API.
The filter_words are aggregated from reading several literatures on suicide prevention and emotion regulation where researchers identified loose or strong association between these words and emotions.
I redacted some of the account related information and other files that are sensitive in nature, so these files won't run without adding the necessary files into the folder.

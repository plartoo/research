This is the survey template written in HTML, CSS and JS/jQuery (with a few
other open-sourced JS library for trivial animation and aesthetics) partially
inspired by Google material design.

The goal of this template is to collect student's opinions about hundreds 
of testimonials written by other students. We want to collect a variable
number of ratings for each testimonial from an unknown (unpredictable) 
number of students. The reason we can't know how many students will 
participate in the survey is because the student raters will be 
recruited at random days and time at different schools. 

This survey template is configured (refactored) in such as way that 
it can handle these dynamic variables and is also easily re-configurable 
for different purposes. For example, if we want to change the Likert
scale used here from 1-5 to 1-7, we can easily change one line of code
and everything will be set. If we want to change the number of questions
shown for each testimonial, we simply need to change one line. You get the
idea. :)

Certainly, the code quality can be improved more, but I think I'm ready 
to use it (in fact, I've used the older versin of this survey for previous
research surveys) in real life obviously due to time pressure and deadlines
to begin our surveys next week.
